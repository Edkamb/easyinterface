\chapter{\ei Server}
\label{ch:server}

This chapter describes the server side of the \ei framework, that we
refer to as the \ei server (or simply the server).
%
As explained in Section~\ref{ch:overview:arch:server}, the goal of
this server is to provide a uniform way to access local applications
and examples (i.e., those installed on the machine where the server
runs).


The \ei server achieves the above goal by:
%
(1) providing a way to describe, using XML based configuration files,
how to execute a local application and which parameters it takes, as
well as define sets of related examples; and
%
(2) providing a JSON based protocol that can be used to request
information on those applications and examples, execute applications,
etc.
%
Section~\ref{ch:server:config} describes the syntax of the server
configuration file; and Section~\ref{ch:server:protocol} describes the
protocol that can be used to communicate with the server.
%
This chapter does not cover issues related to installation, for such
documentation see
\texttt{\href{http://github.com/abstools/easyinterface}{INSTALL.md}}.


\section{Configuring the \ei Server}
\label{ch:server:config}

This section describes how to configure the \ei server.
%
Section~\ref{ch:server:config:file} explains where the configuration
file should be placed, and Section~\ref{ch:server:config:xml}
describes the (valid) content of this file.
%
Before proceeding to the next sections, it is very recommended to read
Chapter~\ref{ch:quickguide} to get a general idea on how the
configuration file looks like, etc.


\subsection{Name and Path of the Configuration File}
\label{ch:server:config:file}

By default the server looks for the configuration file
\texttt{server/config/eiserver.cfg}, and if no such file exists it
uses \texttt{server/config/eiserver.default.cfg}.
%
The default installation comes with a predefined
\texttt{sever/config/eiserver.default.cfg} that includes some demo
applications and corresponding examples. It is very recommended not
make substantial changes to \texttt{eiserver.default.cfg}, and instead
create your own \texttt{eiserver.cfg}. This way you can always have a
correct configuration file at hand from which you can copy, etc.

\subsection{The Syntax of the Configuration File}
\label{ch:server:config:xml}

The content of the configuration file should adhere to the
\xmlstructref{server}{eiserver} XML structure that is described below.
%
Inside this tag you can define applications, examples, etc. The best
way to understand how to do so is follow the links in the definition
of \xmlstructref{server}{eiserver}.

\subsubsection*{General Comments about XML Structures} 

For the purpose of better organization of the configuration files, we
provide a way to split them into several files and import one file
into another one. Any XML structure

\medskip
\begin{lstlisting}
<tagname ...>
  ....
</tagname>
\end{lstlisting}

\medskip
\noindent
can be also written as

\medskip
\begin{lstlisting}
<tagname src=$\xmlstructref{server}{cfgfilename}$/>
\end{lstlisting}

\medskip
\noindent
where the file \xmlstructref{server}{cfgfilename} includes the actual
XML structure (of the first form above). It will be automatically
imported when needed. However, if the XML structure (the first form)
has an attribute \lst{id} then it must appear as an attribute in the
second form as well.

\subsubsection*{The Main XML Tag of the Configuration File}

%% EISERVER
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{eiserver}
{%
This XML tag is the root of the configurations file.
%
The \xmlstructref{server}{settings} section is used for setting some
global parameters; \xmlstructref{server}{examples} defines which sets
of examples are available on the server; and the
\xmlstructref{server}{apps} section defines which applications are
available on the server.
%
}



\subsubsection*{General Settings}

%% SETTINGS
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{settings}
{%
%
  This tag does not include anything yet. It is reserved for future
  use, where we plan to put general settings.
%
}

\subsubsection*{Examples Settings}

%% EXAMPLES
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{examples}
{%
%
  This tag is used to declare sets of examples that are available in
  the server, where each such set is defined by one
  \xmlstructref{server}{exset}.
%
}


%% EXSET
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{exset}
{%
%
  This tag declare a set of examples, which are defined a collection
  of \xmlstructref{server}{exelement} (a file, a directory, or a link to a
  github repository).
%
  The attribute \xmlstructattr{id} is a unique identifier that is used
  to refer to this set when communicating with the server.
%
}


%% EXAMPLE element
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{exelement}
{%
%
  An example element, which can be a file \xmlstructref{server}{file}, a
  folder \xmlstructref{server}{folder}, or a link to a github repository
  \xmlstructref{server}{github}.
%
}



%% File
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{file}
{%
%
  This tags declares a file, where the \xmlstructattr{name} attribute
  is its name and \xmlstructattr{url} is a link to its content. Note
  that \xmlstructattr{name} is not necessarily the same as the one in
  \xmlstructattr{url}.
%
}


%% Folder
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{folder}
{%
%
  This tags declares a folder with \xmlstructattr{name} as its
  name. The content of this tag is a list of
  \xmlstructref{server}{exelement} tags, which in turn declare the
  inner files, folders, etc.
%
}



%% GitHub
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{github}
{%
%
  Declares a reference to the public github repository
  \xmlstructattr{repo} which is owned by the user
  \xmlstructattr{owner}. Optionally one can also refer to a specific
  \xmlstructattr{branch}, which \texttt{master} by default, and to a
  specific path \xmlstructattr{githubpath} (a directory or a single
  file) which is a the root directory by default.
%
}


\subsubsection*{Applications Settings}

%% APPS
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{apps}
{%
%
  This tag declares a list of applications (to be added to the
  server). Each such application is defined by one \xmlstructref{server}{app}
  environment.  
%
} 


%% APP
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{app}
{%
%
  This tag defines an application, where the meaning of the different
  parts is as follows:
%
  \begin{itemize}

  \item \xmlstructattr{id} is a unique identifier used to refer to
    this application when communicating with the server.

  \item \xmlstructattr{visible} indicates if this application should
    be listed when the list of available applications is requested ---
    by default it is \texttt{true}. 
    %
    Note that even if an application is not visible, it can be used
    like any other application by those who know its
    \xmlstructattr{id}.

  \item \xmlstructref{server}{appinfo} provides some general information about
    the application, e.g., title, logo, etc.

  \item \xmlstructref{server}{apphelp} provides enough information on how the
    application can be used, etc. It is mainly used in the help
    sections of the different clients.

  \item \xmlstructref{server}{execinfo} defines how the application can be
    executed (e.g., from a command-line).

  \item \xmlstructref{server}{parameters} defines the set parameters accepted
    by the application.

  \end{itemize}
%
}



%% APPINFO
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{appinfo}
{%
%
  This tag provides general information about an application:
%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlstructref{server}{acronym} is an acronym for the application,
    e.g., COSTA;
  \item \xmlstructref{server}{title} is the full name of the application;
  \item \xmlstructref{server}{logo} is an image corresponding to the logo of
    the application; and
  \item \xmlstructref{server}{desc} is a description of the tool.
  \end{itemize}
%
}



%% ACRONYM
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{acronym}
{%
%
  Plain text to be used as an acronym, e.g., COSTA.
%
}



%% TITLE
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{title}
{%
%
  Plain text describing a title, e.g., for an application. It is
  typically more informative than an acronym (see
  \xmlstructref{server}{acronym}).
%
}



%% LOGO
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{logo}
{%
%
  A link to an image --- in some standard format, .e.g.,
  \xmlstructvalue{png}, \xmlstructvalue{jpg} or \xmlstructvalue{gif}
  --- to be used by clients as a logo (e.g., for an application).
%
}



%% DESC
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{desc}
{%
%
  This is a description of some entities, e.g., of an application, a
  parameter, a parameter option, etc. It consists of two parts, the
  first one is a short description, and the second is a detailed
  description. In both cases it should be plain text. Clients will
  select one of them depending on the intended use.
%
}
{}%


%% APPHELP
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{apphelp}
{%
%
  A (formatted) text that provides enough information on how an
  application can be used, etc. It can be provided in several formats,
  e.g., html or plain text, by using several
  \xmlstructref{server}{content} tags. Clients are supposed to pick
  the appropriate format if more than one is available. It is
  recommended to always include a content in plain text since it can
  be viewed in any client.
%
}



%% CONTENT
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{content}
{%
%
  A text given in a specific \xmlstructattr{format}, e.g.,
  \xmlstructvalue{"text"}, \xmlstructvalue{"html"}, etc. If the
  attribute \xmlstructattr{format} is not provided, then it is assumed
  to be \xmlstructvalue{"text"} format (plain text).
%
}


%% EXECINFO
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{execinfo}
{%
%
  Provides information on how to execute an application. Currently it
  includes only the command-line template
  \xmlstructref{server}{cmdlineapp}.
%
}


%% CMDLINEAPP
\noindent
\xmlstruct
{server}
{cmdlineapp}
{%
%
  Describes how to run an application from a command-line, where
  \xmlstructref{server}{cmdtemplate} is a template describing the
  command-line. It is best explained by an example. Consider the
  following template example

  \bigskip
  ~~~
  \fbox{\small\texttt{/path-to/app \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_files} -m \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_outline}  \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_parameters}}}
  
  \bigskip
  \noindent
  In this template, anything that starts with \xmlstructtemplate{_ei}
  is a template parameter that will be replaced by some corresponding
  value, and \texttt{/path-to/app} is the application
  executable.
  % 
  When the server receives a request for executing the corresponding
  application, the request includes several data that should passed to
  the application. For example, the following are typical data that
  should be passed to an application:
  %
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item files to be processed (e.g., program to be analyzed);
  \item entities selected from the program outline (e.g., methods); and
  \item values for the different parameters.
  \end{enumerate}
  %
  The server passes this data to the application by replacing the
  template parameters with corresponding data as follows:
  % 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the files are stored locally (e.g., in \texttt{/tmp}), and
    \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_files} is replaced by a list file names
    (each with an absolute path, separated by a space);
  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_outline} is replaced by a list of
    selected entities (e.g., method names); and
  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_parameters} is replaced by the list of
    parameters generated from those provided in the request.
  \end{enumerate}
  % 
  This result in, for example, the following instance of the template:

  \bigskip
  \hspace{0.7cm}
  \fbox{\texttt{/path-to/app \xmlstructtemplate{/tmp/ei_FAJw1B/a.c /tmp/ei_FAJw1B/b.c} -m \xmlstructtemplate{a.main} \xmlstructtemplate{-v 1 -d 3 -a}}}

  \bigskip 
  \noindent
  which is then executed and its output is redirected to the
  client. The server does some security checks to guarantee that the
  command-line is not harmful. % TODO refer to the security section when available

  \bigskip 
  \noindent
  The following is a list of template parameters that can be used:

%%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_files} is replaced by a list of file
    names (separated by space) in the local file system;

  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_root} is replaced by the local
    temporary directory name, where all files have been saved;

  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_stream} is replaced by the local
    temporary directory name, where stream aplications have to save
    all files; 

  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_download} is replaced by the local
    temporary directory name, where aplications have to save
    all downloadable files. These files will be accessible from the
    url
    \\http://domain/.../ei/server/Download.php?file=FILENAME\&id=\xmlstructtemplate{_ei_execid}; 
%%
  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_outline} is replaced by a list of
    selected entities (separated by space);
%%
  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_parameters} is replaced by a
    corresponding list of parameters (see \xmlstructref{server}{parameters});
%%
  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_sessionid} is replaced by a session
    identifier, this makes it possible to track the information of a
    user along several request;
%%
  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_clientid} is replaced by the client
    identifier, i.e., \texttt{webclient}, \texttt{eclipse}, etc.,
    which makes it possible to provide output depending on the
    client. See Chapter~\ref{ch:clients} for a list of clients and
    their corresponding identifiers.
%
  \item \xmlstructtemplate{_ei_execid} is replaced by a execution
    identifier, this makes it possible to track the information of a
    concrete execution, especially for stream applications;
  \end{itemize}
%
}


\subsubsection{Application Parameters}

%% PARAMETERS
\bigskip 
\xmlstruct
{server}
{parameters} 
{%
%
  Defines a list of parameters that are accepted by a corresponding
  application. Each parameter is defined by one
  \xmlstructref{server}{param} environment.
  %
  The \xmlstructattr{prefix} attribute is used to specify a string
  that will be attached to each parameter name when passed to the
  application.
  % 
  For example, if \xmlstructattr{prefix}=\xmlstructvalue{"{-}{-}"} and
  there is a parameter called 'level' with value X, then '{-}{-}level
  X' will be passed to the application.  The default value of
  \xmlstructattr{prefix} is \xmlstructvalue{"-"}. It can also be set
  to an empty string if there is no need for a prefix.
  %
  The \xmlstructattr{check} attribute is used to indicate if the
  server should verify that the values of the parameters are valid
  (w.r.t. the specified values). The default value of
  \xmlstructattr{check} is \xmlstructvalue{"true"}.
  %
  The attributes \xmlstructattr{prefix} and \xmlstructattr{check} are
  inherited by each parameter \xmlstructref{server}{param}, which in turn can
  override then as well.
%
}
{}%

%% PARAM
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{param}
{%
%
  Defines a parameter accepted by a corresponding application. There
  are several types of parameters supported:
\begin{itemize}
\item \xmlstructref{server}{selectone} defines a parameter that takes one
  value from a predefined set;
\item \xmlstructref{server}{selectmany} defines a parameter that takes several
  values from a predefined set;
\item \xmlstructref{server}{flag} defines a Boolean parameter; and
\item \xmlstructref{server}{textfield} defines a parameter that takes a
  free-text value.
\end{itemize}
%
}


%% SELECTONE
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{selectone}
{%
%
  Defines a parameter that takes a \emph{single} value out of a given
  list:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlstructattr{name} is the name of the parameter, it must be
    unique among all parameters of an application;

  \item \xmlstructattr{prefix} and \xmlstructattr{check} can be used
    to override the corresponding attributes of
    \xmlstructref{server}{parameters};

  \item \xmlstructref{server}{desc} provides a description of this parameter;

  \item \xmlstructref{server}{option}+ is a list of possible values for
    this parameter;

  \item \xmlstructref{server}{defaultvalue} specifies the default value. If
    not specified then the first \xmlstructref{server}{option} is considered
    as the default one; and

  \item \xmlstructattr{widgetid} specifies the preferred layout when
    used in a client with a graphical interface (e.g., combo-box,
    radio button, etc.). This is client dependent, see
    Chapter~\ref{ch:clients} for more information.

  \end{itemize}
%
}


%% SELECTMANY
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{selectmany}
{%
%
  Defines a parameter that takes \emph{several} values out of a given
  list. The meaning of the attributes and inner environments is as in
  \xmlstructref{server}{selectone}, except that in this case we can specify
  several  \xmlstructref{server}{defaultvalue}.
%
}


%% FLAG
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{flag}
{%
%
  Defines a parameter that can take \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}
  values. The meaning of the attributes and inner environments is as
  in \xmlstructref{server}{selectone}.  The attribute
  \xmlstructattr{explicit} is used to specify how this parameter
  should be passed to the application. For example, assume the
  parameter name is \texttt{f}, then:
  % 
  \begin{itemize}
  %  
  \item when \xmlstructattr{explicit} is \xmlstructvalue{false}, the
    parameter is passed as ``\texttt{-f}'' if its value is
    \texttt{true} and not passed at all if its value is
    \texttt{false}.

  \item when \xmlstructattr{explicit} is \xmlstructvalue{true} the
    parameter is explicitly passed to the application, i.e., using
    ``\texttt{-f X}'' where \texttt{X} is the selected value. The
    posible values are \xmlstructvalue{true} and
    \xmlstructvalue{false}. However, you can redefine them
     (only when \xmlstructattr{explicit} is
    \xmlstructvalue{true}) using the attributes
    \xmlstructattr{trueval} and \xmlstructattr{falseval}.
  % 
  \end{itemize}
%
  The default value of \xmlstructattr{explicit} is
  \xmlstructvalue{false}.
%
}


%% TEXTFIELD
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{textfield}
{%
%
  Defines a parameter that can take free-text value.  The
  \lst{initialtext} tag includes a text to be shown in the
  corresponding text-area by default.  The meaning of the attributes
  is as follows:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item \xmlstructattr{multiline} is used to specify if the free-text
  should be single- or multi-line. By default its values is
  \xmlstructvalue{false}, i.e., single-line.
%
\item \xmlstructattr{passinfile} is used to indicate that the actual
  value should be saved into a file, and what is passed to the
  application is the file name instead of the actual text. 
  % 
  This should be used for safety, when there is a risk that the
  free-text can be harmful to the command-line (although the server
  does some checks to avoid this).
%
\end{itemize}
%
The meaning of the other attributes and inner environments is as in
\xmlstructref{server}{selectone}.
%
}


%% OPTION
\bigskip
\xmlstruct
{server}
{option}
{%
Defines an option (i.e., a possible value) for a parameter.
}


%% Default value

\section{Communicating with the \ei Server}
\label{ch:server:protocol}

This section describes the protocol to be used for communicating with
the \ei server. If you are not developing an \ei client, then this
section is not relevant for you.

The \ei server is a collection of PHP scripts running on top of an
HTTP server. Communicating with the server is done through HTTP POST
requests. 
%
In particular, the request should include an attribute called
``\texttt{eirequest}'' (the actual value of ``\texttt{eirequest}'' is
a JSON record that we will described in the next sections). The
following is an example of how one can communicate with the server
using jQuery:

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}
var req = ...; // the actual JSON record of the request
$\$$.post("http://localhost/ei/server/eiserver.php",
{
  eirequest: req
},
function(data) { 
  // do something with data
});
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip
\noindent
The response of the server is an XML of the following form:

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}
<ei_response>
  <ei_server_output> ... </ei_server_output>
  <ei_output> ... </ei_output>
  <ei_error> ... </ei_error>
</ei_response>
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip
\noindent
Where
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item \lst{ei_server_output} includes messages printed by the
  server. These messages are not the response to the request, but
  rather debugging messages that can be useful when developing
  clients, debugging the server, etc. Most users should ignore this
  environment.
%
\item \lst{ei_output} includes the response to the request, i.e., if
  we request to execute an application the output of that application
  goes inside this tag.
%
\item \lst{ei_error} includes error messages that are related to the
  request.
%
\end{itemize}
%
Typically, \lst{ei_output} and \lst{ei_error} are mutually exclusive,
i.e., only one can appear in the response. 

\bigskip 
%
In the next section we describe the format of the request to (1)
obtain information on the available applications; (2) execute an
application; and (3) retrieve example sets.

\subsection{Retrieve Information on Available Applications}

To retrieve information on a given application, or all visible
applications on the server, use the following request:

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  command: CMD,
  app_id: ID
}
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip
\noindent
where (1) \texttt{CMD} can be \texttt{app\_info},
\texttt{app\_parameters}, or \texttt{app\_details}; and (2)
\texttt{ID} is either the special value \texttt{\_ei\_all} (i.e., all
applications) or an application identifier as specified in
\xmlstructref{server}{app}.
%
A successful request will return (inside the \lst{ei_output} tag) the
XML structure \xmlstructref{server}{apps} (that is defined in the
configuration file) after filtering out some information as we explain
next.
%
First any application that does not match \texttt{ID} is removed (if
\texttt{ID} is \texttt{\_ei\_all} then only non-visible applications
are removed). Then, for the remaining applications:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item if \texttt{CMD} equals \texttt{app\_info}, it returns only the
  \xmlstructref{server}{appinfo} of each application;
%
\item if \texttt{CMD} equals \texttt{app\_parameters}, it returns only the
  \xmlstructref{server}{parameters} of each application; and
%
\item if \texttt{CMD} equals \texttt{app\_details}, it returns
  everything except \xmlstructref{server}{execinfo} of each
  application.
%
\end{itemize}
%
Note that \xmlstructref{server}{execinfo} is never returned as it
reveals information on how to execute an application locally.



\subsection{Execute an Application}

Next we describe, by mean of an example, the form of a request for
executing an application. Suppose we are interested in executing an
application with identifier \texttt{myapp} where, in addition, we
would like to pass it some values for the parameters, files to
process, outline entities, and the identifier of the client who is
making the request. Such a request has the following form:

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  command: (*"execute"*),
  app_id: (*"myapp"*),
  (*parameters*): {
    (*"l"*): (*[ "true" ]*),
    (*"f"*): (*[ "false" ]*),
    (*"s"*): (*[ "yes" ]*),
    (*"x"*): (*[ "1", "2" ]*), 
    (*"\_ei\_clientid"*): (*"webclient"*),

Let us explain the different parts of this request: 
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item \texttt{command} must have the value \texttt{``execute''};
%
\item \texttt{app\_id} should refer to the identifier of the
  application that we want to execute (it can be visible or not);
%
\item \texttt{parameters} is a JSON record that includes all the
  information, e.g., application parameters and files, that we want to
  pass over, as we explain below.
\end{itemize}
%
Before explaining the details of the parameters record, it is
recommend that you refresh your memory with the details of the
command-line template as described
in~\xmlstructref{server}{cmdlineapp}. The parameters record includes
the following information:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item \emph{Application parameters:} any field (of the JSON record)
  whose name does not start with \texttt{\_ei} is a parameter that is
  supposed to be defined in the \xmlstructref{server}{parameters}
  environment of the corresponding application. The value of such
  field is a list of elements that represent the value of the
  parameter. If the parameter is supposed to take a single value then
  the list must have a single element.
%
\item \emph{Files}: the field \texttt{\_ei\_files} represent the files
  that we want to pass to the application. Its value is an array of
  JSON records where each record represent a text file or a directory
  (binary files are not supported yet). The \texttt{path} field of the
  record refers to the file or directory name, it is relative to the
  root of the temporary directory where the server saves these
  files. The \texttt{type} field indicates the type of the file. In
  the case of text files, the field \texttt{content} represent the
  actual content of the file.
%
\item \emph{Outline entities}: the filed \texttt{\_ei\_outline} is a
  list of elements representing the selected entities from the
  outline.
%
\item \emph{Client identifier}: the field \texttt{\_ei\_clientid}
  indicates the identifier of the client who has performed the
  request.
%
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Retrieve Example Sets}

To retrieve the example sets use the following request:

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  command: "exset_details",
  app_id: ID
}
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip
\noindent
where \texttt{ID} is either the special value \texttt{\_ei\_all}
(i.e., all example sets) or an examples set identifier as specified in
\xmlstructref{server}{exset}.
%
A successful request will return (inside the \lst{ei_output} tag) the
XML structure \xmlstructref{server}{examples} (that is defined in the
configuration file) after filtering out those example sets that do not
match the value of \texttt{ID}, i.e, if \texttt{ID} is
\texttt{\_ei\_all} then it returns all example sets, otherwise only
the indicated one.
