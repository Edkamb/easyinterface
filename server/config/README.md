# EasyInterface Server Configuration Files

This directory includes 3 files:

* `eiserver.cfg` is the main configuration file
* `default.cfg` is a configuration file that includes the basic demo applications
* `envisage.cfg` is the configuration file for the **Envisage Collaboratory**

By default, `eiserver.cfg` is a copy of `default.cfg`. For installing
the **Envisage Collaboratory** just copy `envisage.cfg` to
`eiserver.cfg`.
