# Envisage Collaboratory

This directory includes bash script that are used as wrapper to the
analysis tools provided in SACO.

## The seeing file

The file `envisage_setting.sh` is used to set some environment
variables with some information used by other wrapper scripts, e.g.,
paths to tools, etc. In principle, parts of this script should be
generated automatically when you install the **Envisage
Collaboratory**
