*** DONE do we have inline marker?
 We should use lineWidget
 We have highlight part of line

        <file name=".." url=".." />
        <github .... />

** DONE fix layout of remote files
** DONE pass the clientid from the web-interface
** FEEDBACK modify index.html in sever so it checks that the server seems to work correctly. This might require adding something to the server language to test that it work, etc.
** DONE looks like the client requires <parameters> environment to be in the app description, this should be optional
   The problem is: server returns a not wellformed xml, because add
   <?xml version="1.0" ?>
   js cann't parse it. 
   the version Tag is generate by simpleXMLelement, when is printted
   with "asXML".
   one solution is: explode("\n", $xml->asXML(), 2)[1];
   but its very ugly, 
   other more ugly: substr($xml, strpos($xml, '?'.'>') + 2);
   other: rewrite php using other XML writer
   and the last one: is require write <parameters></parameters>.. but
   this dont solve the problem.
*** SOLUTION:
    en eiserver.php remove all <?xml ... ?> with RegExpr
** FEEDBACK the flag parameter accepts yes/no instead of true and false
** DONE in the selectone parameter, if the desc is not provided use value to show the different values. The same for select many i guess.
** DONE Test-i execute each command
** DONE Remove proxy possibility
** DONE merge lib and ext folders in web client
** FEEDBACK Apply/Refresh does not work on a single file, looks like the directory names are not built correctly (not sure)
** DONE BUG: oncodelineclickaction?? is codelineaction??
** TODO SVG Streaming
Web Service, call it to get new commands or actions.
** TODO Time line command
** TODO Example of SVG animation
** TODO selectors do not work with svg in jquery, we should find a workaround. SVG stuff should be redesigned
   changecss, onclick and all the commands that works with
   selectors. only work with the existing elements. It means: If we add a
   svg and add onclick at same time, we cannt asume that svg is printed
   first. (all are async).
