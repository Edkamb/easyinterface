# EasyInterface

EasyInterface is a framework for rapidly building frontend interfaces. In a minute you can make your (command-line) application running through a web-interface, Eclipse, remote-shell, etc. All you need is to provide a configuration file describing how to run your application, e.g., from a command-line, and which parameters it takes.

In addition, if you modify your application to use the **EasyInterface Output Language**, which is a simple XML based language, you will be able to present the output graphically, e.g., highlighting text, opening dialog boxes, adding markers, defining on-click actions, etc.

EasyInterface consists of a server side, where applications are installed, and several clients (web, eclipse, etc.) that provide access to the applications installed on the server. EasyInterface can run on Linux, OS X, and Microsoft Windows. For a quick installation guide see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

EasyInterface was originally developed for building a frontend for the tools developed in the [Envisage Project](http://www.envisage-project.eu), if you are interested in using EasyInterface as a frontend for these tools see [ENVISAGE.md](ENVISAGE.md).
